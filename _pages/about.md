I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington's Information School, working with Dr. Tanushree Mitra and Dr. Bill Howe. My research examines how theories of epistemic cognition can inform the development of large language models. I study how AI systems process and validate knowledge in dynamic environments, with a focus on personalizing machine reasoning based on users' epistemic preferences.

My work explores methods for adapting language models to different epistemic stances and knowledge evaluation strategies. Through research in retrieval-augmented generation and probabilistic reasoning, I develop approaches for AI systems to engage with diverse modes of human reasoning while maintaining transparency about their own knowledge limitations.
